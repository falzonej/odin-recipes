    You’ve probably ordered carne asada in a restaurant before, so maybe you already know that you really love to eat it! But do you know much about it, beyond the fact of its deliciousness? Carne asada means “grilled meat” in Spanish, though the phrase has come to connote a particular variety of meals and celebrations throughout Latin and South America, as well as in the American Southwest, and one of the most well-known of those meals is this particular dish—marinated, grilled steak that’s often served as (the greatest ever) taco filling.

    As the name implies, carne asada is all about the flavor of grilled meat—rich and hearty—and our carne asada marinade is intended to enhance that intrinsic goodness, not overpower it. In fact, many argue that true, authentic carne asada should have no marinade at all! But we can’t pass up a chance to add a little extra flavor to any meal, so we’ve gone the way of the marinade. That said, we’re keeping it simple and classic. Our go-to carne asada marinade ingredients are:
